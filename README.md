# BRANCH BUILDER

This repository contains the code for a blender script that creates hollow branching network objects for use as geometries in CFD. It works by reading a CSV file of the branch data. Each branch is represented by a row in the CSV file. The model approximates branches as straight and cylindrical with spheres at each bifurcation point and the ends of terminal branches.
